# Welcome!

This is a course about Bayesian statistics, targeted at computational biologists

The course currently takes place physically over three weeks in the summer at DTU Biosustain. If you are taking or want to take that course, congratulations you are in the right place! If not, you may still find something interesting here!

The aim of the course is to teach students with a background in computational biology how to:

- Describe Bayesian inference in the abstract
- Assess whether Bayesian inference is a good fit for a problem
- Formulate custom measurement models to describe biological problems
- Solve statistical modelling problems by iteratively fitting and evaluating a series of models
- Choose appropriate software for a Bayesian statistical modelling project
- Understand gradient-based MCMC techniques and their failure modes
- Fit biological models with embedded ODE systems, root-finding problems and Gaussian processes.
- Perform Bayesian optimisation
- Understand recent trends in Bayesian statistical inference 

The learning material consists of 20 sessions, each intended to take up half a day over two weeks. The third week of the course is set aside for the students to complete a project. For the first two weeks, the first half-day will generally cover theoretical topics, with the second consisting of practical, computer-based tasks.

## How to follow the practical lessons?

All of the lessons come with companion jupyter notebooks in the folder `docs/course`.

To follow a lesson, first make a new folder in the project root, maybe called `notebooks`, copy the lesson's companion note in there and start running cells.
