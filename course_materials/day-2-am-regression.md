# Day 2 am: Regression and formula-based models

## Regression

Recall from the previous session that one of the advantages of Bayesian statisticasl inference---aka using a sample to answer questions about a population in the form of probability statements---is that probability functions decompose into the following form:

$$
p(y, \theta) \propto p(\theta)p(y\mid\hat{y}(\theta))
$$
